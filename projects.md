## Projects

1. **Custom Named-Entity-Recognition using BERT**
   **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, FastAPI  
   [View Project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/Custom-Named-Entity-Recognition)
   Designed and developed a Custom NER model using transfer learning on BERT, acting as a resume parser to extract useful information from resumes based on user-defined fields such as Education, Skills, Experience, Location, Interests, etc. The model achieved an accuracy of **74%** and was served as an application wrapped using FastAPI.


2. **Automatic Speech Recognition using Wav2Vec2 XLSR-53 for Low-Resource Languages**
   **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace  
   [View Project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/xlsr-wav2vec2-asr-marathi)
   Trained the language model of `facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53` on Marathi language for ASR by fine-tuning on the Open SLR64 Marathi dataset. Achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) on the test set of **12.70%** with input data sampled at 16kHz. Implemented as part of the HuggingFace XLSR Open-Source Sprint for low-resource languages.


3. **NFL RosterGen: Optimizing NFL Roster Construction using Genetic Algorithms**
   [View Project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/NFL-Team-Construction-1)
   Roster construction and optimization in the NFL to create better team construction strategies using a family of genetic algorithms to objectively select players, coupled with an ML-based fitness function used to evaluate a teamâ€™s quality.


4. **NLP Playground**
   **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch-Lightning, FastAPI, AWS Lambda  
   [View Project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/NLPPlayground)
   Trained and fine-tuned different domain-specific language models of BERT variants for downstream NLP tasks like masked and unmasked text prediction and abstractive text summarization. The solution was deployed on a serverless cloud.


5. **Prediction and Semantic Classification of Myers-Briggs Personality Types from User-Provided Text**
   **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch  
   [View Project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/MyersBriggs-Personality-Detection)
   Sponsored final year undergrad research project. Architected a model that predicts personality type according to MBTI based on user-written text input, with a comparative study of classification techniques for word-vector representations and embeddings. Achieved an accuracy score of **78%** on predicted personality types.


6. **Abstractive Text Summarization using Transformers**
   **Technologies:** Python, PyTorch  
   [View Project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/Summarization-Ecommerce-Reviews)
   Performed extractive text summarization on Amazon product reviews across multiple categories. Improved the generalization of model performances of BART, T5, and PEGASUS to adapt to out-of-domain text inputs through fine-tuning.
