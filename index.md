## 👤 About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's degree in Data Science from SUNY University at Buffalo and 3+ years of industry experience. **I'm actively seeking full-time employment opportunities in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.** My expertise lies in ML/AI, Data Science, MLOps, and software engineering for ML products.

I have experience handling everything from brainstorming to deploying ML projects, including ideation, research, model development, and maintenance. I'm skilled in developing scalable applications, building RESTful APIs, and deploying cloud-based ML models (AWS, GCP) in production.

My current research interests lie in Applied ML, Language Modelling, and training optimization techniques, especially in the domain of unstructured text. I'm passionate about exploring and contributing to the intersection of ML and software engineering.

Apart from work, I enjoy playing music, video games, and traveling.
