**Projects**

**Custom Named-Entity-Recognition using BERT** 

(Python, Pytorch, FastAPI) 
[view project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/Custom-Named-Entity-Recognition)

Designed and developed a Custom NER model using transfer learning on BERT, acts as a resume parser to extract useful
information from resumes based on user defined information in fields of Education, Skills, Experience, Location, Interests, etc.
The model achieved an accuracy of 74% and was served as an application wrapped using FastAPI

**Automatic Speech Recognition using Wav2Vec2 XLSR-53 for low-resource languages**

(Python, Pytorch, Huggingface)
[view project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/xlsr-wav2vec2-asr-marathi)

Trained the language model of facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53 on Marathi language for ASR by fine-tuning on the Open
SLR64 Marathi dataset. Achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) on the Test Set of 12.70% with input data sampled at 16kHz.
Project was implemented as part of the Huggingface XLSR Open-Source Sprint for low resource languages


**NLP Playground**

(Python, Pytorch-Lightning, FastAPI, AWS Lambda) 
[view project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/NLPPlayground)

Trained and fine-tuned different domain specific Language Models of BERT variants for downstream NLP tasks of Masked and
Unmasked Text Prediction and Abstractive Text Summarization. The solution was deployed on a serverless cloud 


**Prediction and Semantic Classification of Myers-Briggs Personality Types from user provided text**

(Python, Pytorch) 
[view project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/MyersBriggs-Personality-Detection)

Sponsored final year undergrad research project. Architected a model, given a user written text input, predicts personality type according to
its MBTI type with comparative study for its classification techniques for word-vector representations and embeddings. Achieved
an accuracy score of 78% on predicted personality type


**Extractive Text Summarization using Transformers**

(Python, Pytorch)
[view project](https://github.com/sumedhkhodke/CSE_676_project)

Performed extractive text summarization on amazon text reviews on products across multiple categories. Improved on the generalization of model performanaces of BART, T5 and PEGASUS to adapt to out of domain text inputs through fine-tuning.
