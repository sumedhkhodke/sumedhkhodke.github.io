I am an Incoming Master's student in **Data Science** at the [University of Buffalo, NY](https://www.buffalo.edu/) for Fall 2021.
I like to work in the sphere of intersection of **machine learning** and **software engineering** stuff with special interests in **Natural Language Processing**. 
Previously worked as a **SWE in ML** at a growth-stage [startup](https://www.rubiscape.io/) in Pune, India
